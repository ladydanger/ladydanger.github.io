  Hi.
</p>
<p>
  My name is Vi and this is my plain html personal site.  It's still a work in progress.  Don't expect to find selfies, belfies or personal opinions here.  But perhaps you might find some posts about business, accounting or other fun stuff like that (time permitting).

<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  From July to September of 2015, my team, Team Melbourne became the first Australian sponsored team for Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015.  We contributed to an advertising plugin that helped serve Google DoubleClick for Publishers, Google Adsense and Amazon Affiliate Ads on Discourse forums.  Intially, I reached out to Sam (part of the Discourse team) regarding submitting this project because at that time, I ran a discourse forum (albeit very small) and wanted ads on it - so the project met a simple need that many others had.

  During normal working hours where people go to the office, I am working on my business or tidying up my home KonMari style.  The websites I operate are::
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.examsuccess.com.au/"><b>ExamSuccess.com.au</b> - helps students prepare for exams such as IELTS, Selective School Entrance Exams and Scholarship Tests.</a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.connect2accountants.com/"><b>Connect2Accountants.com</b> - a forum to help people with accounting related matters.</a>
</p>

  I'm not active on social media but here are links to two of my public profiles - I'm afraid that you might find them... underwhelming.
